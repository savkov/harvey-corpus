### About Harvey
The Harvey corpus is a collection of linguistically annotated de-identified clinical text. 
The data consists of primary care patient examination notes (GP notes) with layers of linguistic annotation.
The data was licensed to the PREP project at the University of Sussex and the Brighton and Sussex Medical School.
The first annotation layer contains part of speech tags automatically assigned by [cTAKES](http://ctakes.apache.org/index.html). 
The other two layers consist of manually annotated syntactic chunks and named entities (expressions).
